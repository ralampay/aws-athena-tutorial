# Exercise 1: Basic Aggregation

Letâ€™s create a basic aggregation query in AWS Athena using a sample table. The query will calculate the total sales per product category by summing up the quantity_sold and multiplying it by the price.

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket and Upload a CSV File

First, upload a CSV file with the following sales data into S3 bucket:

```
product_id,product_name,category,quantity_sold,price
1,Smartphone,Electronics,50,700
2,Headphones,Electronics,100,100
3,T-shirt,Clothing,200,20
4,Jeans,Clothing,150,50
5,Microwave,Home Appliances,30,150
6,Blender,Home Appliances,80,80
```

## Step 2: Create an Athena Table

Provide the `CREATE TABLE` query.

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales_data (
    product_id INT,
    product_name STRING,
    category STRING,
    quantity_sold INT,
    price DOUBLE
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
    'separatorChar' = ',',
    'quoteChar' = '"'
)
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket-name/path-to-your-csv/'
TBLPROPERTIES ('has_encrypted_data'='false');
```

## Step 3: Aggregation Query

Create a basic aggregation query to calculate the total sales per category.

```
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(quantity_sold * price) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category;
```
